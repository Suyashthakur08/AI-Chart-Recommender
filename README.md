Insight Engine is a sophisticated full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights. By leveraging the power of Google's Gemini AI, this tool intelligently analyzes uploaded CSV or XLSX files and automatically recommends the most effective and relevant data visualizations.

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of modern web development practices, featuring a decoupled frontend, a high-performance RESTful API backend, and seamless integration with a third-party AI service.

## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

The application follows a standard client-server model:

<p align="center">
  <pre>
  +-----------------+      HTTP Request      +----------------+      API Call       +-------------------+
  |                 |  (File, /analyze/)   |                |  (Data Summary)  |                   |
  | Frontend (User) |--------------------> |  Backend API   |------------------>|  Google Gemini AI |
  | (Browser)       |                      | (FastAPI)      |                  |     (LLM)         |
  |                 |  <--------------------|                | <------------------|                   |
  |                 |   (JSON with Charts) |                |   (JSON with      |                   |
  +-----------------+      HTTP Response     +----------------+   Recommendations) +-------------------+
  </pre>
</p>

1.  The **Frontend** captures the user's file upload.
2.  It sends the file to the `/analyze/` endpoint on the **Backend API**.
3.  The **Backend** reads the file with Pandas, creates a concise summary, and sends this summary to the **Google Gemini API**.
4.  Gemini returns a structured JSON list of chart recommendations.
5.  The backend uses Matplotlib to generate a PNG image for each recommendation, encodes it to Base64, and sends the complete data back to the frontend.
6.  The frontend dynamically renders the results for the user.
